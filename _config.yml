  Soon to be PhD graduate in Cognitive Psychology from The Ohio State University with over a decade of data wrangling experience. My research has revolved around applying a stochastic model of decision making, the diffusion decision model, to understand how visual working memory is represented in mind and how this representation influences the decision making process. Investigating such a fundamental aspect of human cognition is key to understanding how people interact with the world. 

  I have a passion for learning and improving myself especially when it comes to understanding data. I am always trying to learn more about about statistical, computational, and machine learning methods in order to examine a dataset from as many perspectives as possible. Through coursework I have learned many statistical techniques such as multivariate linear regression, logistic regression, and Bayesian analysis and what questions these techniques can answer. I have applied these methodologies to class projects in addition to some of my publications. 

  I have taken it upon myself to learn the best ways in which to visualize results in order to help convey a story I'm trying to tell. This is the most exciting part of the data lifecycle, making sense of results and creating a cohesive and engaging story. I have much experience with this, whether it is presenting at conferences, preparing a manuscript for publication, discussing a class project or lecturing a class.

  In relation to implementing these analyses and visualizations, R is my programming language of choice, but I have learned many other languages such as MATLAB, Python, and bash scripting when R fell short. I understand different languages have different strengths and I have to be flexible in order to best serve my purpose. I am looking to enter industry in the Data Science (or related) field.
